////Class Coupling = A measure of how interconnected classes and subsystems are

////*BAD* Tightly Coupled= An app that have Classes tightly related to each other 
////*GOOD* Loosely Coupled= Not Dependent on other Classes

////How to Design Loosely Coupled?
////*Encapulation= Using Access Modifiers, restrict what other Classes see
////*Relationship between Classes
////*Interfaces
